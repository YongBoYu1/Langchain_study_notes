These scripts can be tailored to specific requirements and scenarios, helping to identify bugs and issues in the software.\\n\\n2. Test Data Generation: Langsmith can generate test data that covers a wide range of input parameters and edge cases. This helps to ensure comprehensive test coverage and thorough validation of the software.\\n\\n3. Performance Testing: Langsmith can help with performance testing by generating load and stress test scenarios. This can help to identify potential bottlenecks and performance issues in the software.\\n\\n4. Regression Testing: Langsmith can generate scripts for regression testing to ensure that new code changes do not introduce new bugs or issues into the software.\\n\\n5. Continuous Integration: Langsmith can integrate with CI/CD pipelines to automate the testing process and provide quick feedback on code changes. This helps to ensure that software quality is maintained throughout the development lifecycle.\\n\\nOverall, Langsmith can help streamline testing processes, improve test coverage, and ensure the overall quality of the software being developed.'"

The main difference is this is optimized for ease of use with OpenAPI endpointsConversationalRetrievalChainRetrieverThis chain can be used to have conversations with a document. It takes in a question and (optional) previous conversation history. If there is previous conversation history, it uses an LLM to rewrite the conversation into a query to send to a retriever (otherwise it just uses the newest user input). It then fetches those documents and passes them (along with the conversation) to an LLM to respond.StuffDocumentsChainThis chain takes a list of documents and formats them all into a prompt, then passes that prompt to an LLM. It passes ALL documents, so you should make sure it fits within the context window the LLM you are using.ReduceDocumentsChainThis chain combines documents by iterative reducing them. It groups documents into chunks (less than some context length) then passes them into an LLM. It then takes the responses and continues to do this until it can fit everything into one final LLM call. Useful when you have a lot of documents, you want to have the LLM run over all of them, and you can do in parallel.MapReduceDocumentsChainThis chain first passes each document through an LLM, then reduces them using the ReduceDocumentsChain. Useful in the same situations as ReduceDocumentsChain, but does an initial LLM call before trying to reduce the documents.RefineDocumentsChainThis chain collapses documents by generating an initial answer based on the first document and then looping over the remaining documents to refine its answer. This operates sequentially, so it cannot be parallelized. It is useful in similar situatations as MapReduceDocuments Chain, but for cases where you want to build up an answer by refining the previous answer (rather than parallelizing calls).MapRerankDocumentsChainThis calls on LLM on each document, asking it to not only answer but also produce a score of how confident it is. The answer with the highest confidence is then returned. This is useful when you have a lot of documents, but only want to answer based on a single document, rather than trying to combine answers (like Refine and Reduce methods do).ConstitutionalChainThis chain answers, then attempts to refine its answer based on constitutional principles that are provided. Use this when you want to enforce that a chain‚Äôs answer follows some principles.LLMChainElasticsearchDatabaseChainElasticSearch InstanceThis chain converts a natural language question to an ElasticSearch query, and then runs it, and then summarizes the response. This is useful for when you want to ask natural language questions of an Elastic Search databaseFlareChainThis implements FLARE, an advanced retrieval technique. It is primarily meant as an exploratory advanced retrieval method.ArangoGraphQAChainArango GraphThis chain constructs an Arango query from natural language, executes that query against the graph, and then passes the results back to an LLM to respond.GraphCypherQAChainA graph that works with Cypher query languageThis chain constructs an Cypher query from natural language, executes that query against the graph, and then passes the results back to an LLM to respond.FalkorDBGraphQAChainFalkor DatabaseThis chain constructs a FalkorDB query from natural language, executes that query against the graph, and then passes the results back to an LLM to respond.HugeGraphQAChainHugeGraphThis chain constructs an HugeGraph query from natural language,', metadata={'description': 'Chains refer to sequences of calls - whether to an LLM, a tool, or a', 'language': 'en', 'source': 'https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/chains', 'title': 'Chains | ü¶úÔ∏èüîó Langchain'})],\n",
